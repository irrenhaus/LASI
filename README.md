# LASI

Lazily Acronymed Start Interface

## What is this?

LASI is a start page for web browsers. While I'm mostly just making this for personal use, feel free to copy it and modify it to suit your own usage. I plan on adding many more features to this start page in the future. Credit to [/u/jarvvski](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages/comments/5gjfpv/terminal_in_the_browser/) for the code this is based off of.

## Planned features
* Last.fm summary graph option (I'm a music and data nerd)
* Make boxes move more dynamically for the current window/screen size (ie change from arranged left-right to up-down on phones, etc.)
* Eventual settings that can be saved per-user, since right now it's just a static page
* Potentially also eventually packaged into a Chrome extention to make a more seamless new-tab page
* Whatever else future me decides to do
